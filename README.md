Explanation:

    Libraries:

        This code uses the libcurl library to make HTTP requests to an external VPN detection API. You need to have libcurl installed and linked to UnrealIRCd for this module to work.

    VPN Detection:

        The vpn_check_ip() function makes a request to a VPN detection API (e.g., IPQualityScore). This is where you'd plug in your API key and handle the actual detection logic.

        In this example, the response is checked for a JSON field "vpn": true to determine if the IP is a VPN. The exact structure depends on the API service you're using.

    Hooking into Connection:

        The module hooks into UnrealIRCdâ€™s HOOK_PRE_CONNECT to check if an IP is a VPN whenever a new user connects to the IRC server. If the IP is flagged as a VPN, the user is banned by calling ircd_on_kill().

    Ban Logic:

        If the IP is detected as a VPN, the module sends a private message to the user and then disconnects (bans) the user from the server.

Step 2: Module Compilation

To compile the module, place the mod_vpn_ban.c file in the modules directory of your UnrealIRCd installation. Then, compile the module:

cd unrealircd
./config
make modules

After compilation, load the module by adding the following line to your unrealircd.conf:

loadmodule "modules/mod_vpn_ban.so";

Then, restart UnrealIRCd:

./unrealircd restart

Important Notes:

    API Key: Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key for the VPN detection service you're using.

    API Response Parsing: The response parsing from the API (strstr(response, "\"vpn\": true")) is just an example. You'll need to adjust it based on the actual response format from your chosen VPN detection provider.

    Performance: Making an external HTTP request for every connection may introduce latency. Consider using an asynchronous request handler or caching results to improve performance.

    IP Detection Accuracy: VPN detection APIs are not always 100% accurate. False positives or negatives may occur, so fine-tuning the logic might be necessary based on your user base.
